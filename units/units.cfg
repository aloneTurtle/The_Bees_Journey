    description= _ "In the world known to humans, insects are the most familiar arthropods, dwelling in diverse habitats ranging from grasslands and forests to waters and deserts. They are often spoken of as creatures of poor intelligence, yet sometimes they astonish people with abilities and behaviors that defy common knowledge.

Study of them remains far from mature, and much lies shrouded in mystery."
