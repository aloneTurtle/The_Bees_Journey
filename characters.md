A princess raised on the island that serves as the story’s starting point, and the heir to the Kingdom of Bees. As mentioned in the introduction, she has been intelligent from an early age and is beloved by the worker bees, but due to her immaturity (especially at first), she sometimes struggles to manage her emotions effectively. She inherited her battlefield command skills from Melissa and can also wield the mystical flame, which symbolizes their royal lineage.

She is generally a cheerful character who tries to be friendly with everyone at first. She also has a slightly optimistic streak. However, when she is forced to leave the home island and loses Queen Melissa, who was an absolute presence for her, her inner world begins to darken significantly. Her grief unconsciously drives her growth. For the hornets who killed her mother, she fundamentally harbors no desire for revenge. After learning the truth from Fersen, she even feels sympathy towards them.

Later on, it is revealed that her real mother is Valois. Even so, Melissa remains her beloved family, and despite agonizing over the conflict within her, she resolves to kill Valois.

Noaille is a special presence to Marie alongside Melissa, sharing a bond akin to parent and child. While Noaille interacts with Marie with a certain awareness of their master-servant relationship, Marie remains completely unaware.Marie holds different feelings for each of the two comrades she meets during her journey. She considers Dragochan a friend who shares both hardships and joys, speaking to him without any reservations whatsoever. However, she feels more sympathy towards Kaldyn, searching for a way to save his broken heart.

Ultimately, she became the first queen of the new kingdom and authored The Bee’s Journey, chronicling her entire journey. In other words, she is the narrator of this campaign.
