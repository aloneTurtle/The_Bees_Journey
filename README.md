**The Bee’s Journey** (**TBJ**) is an add-on campaign for [Battle for Wesnoth](https://www.wesnoth.org).

## Description

That summer, the Kingdom of Bees was destroyed under the hornet invasion. You, the lone surviving princess, must lead the bees on their journey to rebuild the homeland.

**(Intermediate level, 12 scenarios planned, currently 5 playable.)**

## Notice

Currently, I am reworking it as version 2.0. While the timing is still undetermined, I plan to release it for Wesnoth 1.20.x.
